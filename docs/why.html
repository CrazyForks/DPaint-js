<h2>Why ?</h2>

There are many many excellent paint programs out there.<br><br>
Next to the unavoidable PhotoShop there are many excellent pixel art tools like
<a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Asesprite</a>,
<a href="https://www.cosmigo.com/pixel_animation_software" target="_blank">ProMotion NG</a>,
<a href="http://grafx2.chez.com/" target="_blank">GrafX2</a>,...
<br>
And even brilliant browser based image editors like <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" target="_blank">PhotoPea</a>,
<a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" target="_blank">Piskel</a> or
<a href="https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama/" target="_blank">Pixelorama</a>, ...

<br><br>

So why make another one?<br><br>
The main reason is that I wanted a modern tool for creating Amiga Icons, a long gone ancient file format that no modern editor supports.
(And that even the icon editors on the Amiga platform struggle with)<br>
Next to that I was missing some pixel-specific features that I knew from the good old Deluxe Paint days.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.stef.be/dpaint/">DPaint.js</a> was born: a tool that combines the pixel approach of Deluxe Paint with the modern features of today's image editors
and the platform independent nature of browser based applications.<br><br>
<br><br>
