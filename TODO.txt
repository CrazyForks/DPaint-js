Bugs:

Transforming a mask clears the layer ?
resizing sizebox negatively, makes the sizebox 0 width/height
resize image to larger doesn't clear all cached data (like the drawlayer?)
copy/paste/undo shortcut doesn't work on Firefox
fill tool is active when scrollbar is clicked
when aplying color palette changes - they get applied to the top layer instead of the active layer
scrolling removes selection mask


transform layer in touch screens?
