Bugs:


Changing the palette color depth squashes all layers?
Transforming a mask clears the layer ?
resizing sizebox negatively, makes the sizebox 0 width/height
resize image to larger doesn't clear all cached data (like the drawlayer?)
copy/paste/undo shortcut doesn't work on Firefox
fill tool is active when scrollbar is clicked
when aplying color palette changes - they get applied to the top layer instead of the active layer
scrolling removes selection mask
transform layer in touch screens?
Drawing a line over the edge wraps around to the other side
drag/drop should import as new layer ?
Brush-settings: sliders/values don't sync between panel and toolbar


TODO before release:
(why was there a check for "meta key down"? rotate brush stuff?
eydropper should not beactive while drawing a line)
